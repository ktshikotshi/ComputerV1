# ComputerV1 # 
Solves simple polynomials upto the 2nd degree
Doesn't follow OO standards because there is no need as pretty simple to understand as it is and only serves a specific perpose.

## Features ##
> * Reduction of Equation down to a*X^2 + b*X^1 + c*X^0 = 0
> * Simplifying of fractions down to irreducible fractional value.
> * Show intermediary steps for solving equation.
> * Enput(syntax/format) Error handling
> * only displys term if it's none zero (for reduced view)
