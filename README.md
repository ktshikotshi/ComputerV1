# ComputerV1 # 
Solves simple polynomials upto the 2nd degree
Doesn't follow OO standards because there is no need as pretty simple to understand as it is and only serves a specific perpose.

## Features ##
> * Accepts input in natural form and all output is served in natural form.
> * Reduction of Equation down to (a)X^2 + (b)X + c = 0
> * displays all none zero terms on the left hand side of the equation.
> * Simplifying of fractions down to irreducible fractional value.
